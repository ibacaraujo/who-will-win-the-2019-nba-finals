# Who will win the 2019 NBA Finals?

Open the notebook, understand the data scraping, the process and the meaning per se. Explore the prediction strategy. Surprise yourself or not with the champion prediction. I just can say that strength in numbers make sense.

Work in progress, but the 2019 NBA Finals is already happening so I focus on quick and dirty modeling. Graphs to be added, they can provide insightful comprehension in the aspect of the project, regardless of the champion result.

For the web scraping process, this [great tutorial](https://medium.com/data-hackers/como-fazer-web-scraping-em-python-23c9d465a37f) was what I used. I was already decided to do some data science work about NBA Finals. I had already found the [Basketball Reference's site](https://www.basketball-reference.com), and then, when I was trying to begin web scraping, the tutorial was a great match with my intentions.
